# T5 Training


The T5 model which has been trained on the Spider Dataset and used in both our zero shot experiments with Picard can be found here: https://huggingface.co/tscholak/cxmefzzi

This model was then fined tuned (no changes were made to the T5 trainer) on the FootballDB data (`/data/FootballDB/`).
