# FootballDB Dataset

- [`v1`](./v1) contains the SQL scripts to create the v1 database in `./v1/db/`
- [`v2`](./v2) contains the SQL scripts to create the v2 database in `./v2/db/`
- [`v3`](./v3) contains the SQL scripts to create the v3 database in `./v3/db/`

Each folder also contains the train and test (dev) data in different splits (100, 200, 300) to train the NL-to-SQL systems in [`../../src/train`](../../src/train/).
For the v3 data model, we further provide an additional labeled set of 859 NL-SQL pairs.
